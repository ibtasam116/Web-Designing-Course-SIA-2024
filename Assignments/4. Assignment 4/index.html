                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>This is muti-part assignment with the objective of making you comfortable working with HTML and CSS.
                    By
                    the end of this assignment, you will have styled some rectangular blocks and creative a simple
                    version
                    of Twitter's home page.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If this assignment seems overwhelming to you, please come see a TA at TA hours to talk through some
                    strategies for tacking it. We expect this assignment to be a time-consuming assignment as we cover a
                    lot
                    of fundamental techniques. But with a good strategy, it can be finished in a reasonable amount of
                    time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Note: Only CSS and HTML will be used for this assignment. If you want to use JavaScript (or libraries
                    such as jQuery) then feel free to, but we will only be grading correctness on your CSS and HTML.</p>

                <p>Now that you understand some of the basics of HTMK and CSS, let's take a look at how to align HTML
                    elements. There are multiple ways to align HTML elements, but in this part , we recommend using
                    flexboxes as they are widely used in modern web development (for example BootstrapV4 is built on top
                    of
                    flexboxes).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Refer to this great webpage on how to use flexboxes: <span class="yellow">CSS Flexbox Guide</span>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Also feel free to use online resources such as Stack Overflow, MDN, W3, and Google for reference.</p>

                    As a reminder, it's a good idea to run your HTML and CSS syntax through validators. You should also
                    consider using an accessibility checker such as WAVE.

                    There are hundreds of HTML and CSS tags: properties: and values; and we do not expect students to
                    learn
                    each one by heart. However, this assignment and the first lab are intended for you to intuitively
                    understand the languages. and to be proficient at knowing how to tackle a design by the end of the
                    semester.

                    If you're having problems, there are many guides on HTML and CSS online (CSSTricks and MDN are your
                    friends), as well as on our resources page.

                    As always. if you are stuck on a particular part. you can always talk to the friendly TAs or ask
                    questions on course piazza (check your email for a signup link).

                <p class="bold">
                    As a general rule of thumb, do not expect TAs to be able to solve every web problem you have. Even
                    the
                    most adept web developer can struggle a lot with specific CSS rules to use.
