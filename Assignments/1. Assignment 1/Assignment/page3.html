                <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
            </b></dt>
        <dd>When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic <b>HTML </b>and Semantic <b>HTML. </b>The word
            semantic means <b><i>"related to meaning", </i></b> so semantic elements provide information about the
            content between the opening and closing tags.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dd>By using Semantic <b>HTML </b>, we select <b>HTML </b>elements based on their meaning, not on how they are
            presented. Elements such as <b>&lt;div&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;span&gt; </b>are not semantic elements since they
            provide no context as to what is inside of those tags.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dd>
            For example, instead of using a <b>&lt;div&gt; </b> element to contain our header information, we could use
            a <b>&lt;header&gt; </b>element, which is used as a heading section. By using a <b>&lt;header&gt; </b>tag
            instead of a <b>&lt;div&gt;, </b>we provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and
            closing tag.
        </dd>

    <h3><b>Why Use Semantic Elements?</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li><b>Accessibility: </b>Semantic <b>HTML </b>makes webpages accessible for mobile device and for people
                with
                disabilities as well. This is because screen reader and browsers are able to interpret the code better.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>
                <b>SEO: </b>it improves the website <b>SEO, </b>or <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization,
                which is
                the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpages. With better <b>SEO,</b> search
                engines are better able to identity the content of your website and weight the most important content
                appropriately.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Easy ro Understand: </b>Semantic <b>HTML </b>also makes the wensite's source code easier to read for
                other web developers.</li>
        </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <b>HTML</b> to going
        into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled, you don't know what products are in
        those aisles. However, stores that do have sign for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need,
        just like Semantic <b>HTML.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many web sites contain <b>HTML </b>code like: <b>&lt;div id="header"&gt;, &lt;div
            id="nav"&gt;, &lt;div id="main"&gt;, &lt;div id="footer"&gt; </b>to indicate header, navigation, main
        content and footer.
